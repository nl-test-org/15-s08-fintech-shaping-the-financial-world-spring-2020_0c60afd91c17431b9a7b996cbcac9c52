Synopsis

This course is for students wishing to explore the ways in which new technologies are disrupting the financial services industry—driving material change in business models, products, applications and customer user interface. Amongst the significant technological trends affecting financial services into the 2020’s, the class will explore AI, deep learning, blockchain technology, and open APIs. We will then turn to four sectors of specific opportunities: payments, credit, trading and risk management. We will explore the competitive and strategic landscape amongst FinTech start-ups, incumbents from big finance and big tech in the U.S., China, India, and Europe. Students will gain an understanding of the key technologies, market structure, participants, regulation and the dynamics of change being brought about by FinTech.
